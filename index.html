          <h2><img src="assets/images/user.svg">Who I am</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Tyler Huffer. I'm a freelance web designer, web developer and internet guru. I live in Iowa City IA, a small college town in the middle of rural Iowa about a 3 hour drive from Chicago and almost 2 hours from Des Moines. I am able to code websites from scratch (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript) additionally I develop websites with Wordpress or CSS frameworks from start to finish. I am also proficient in Adobe Creative Suites as well as many other tools and libraries.</p> <br/>
          <p>I have over 4 years of professional experience designing and developing websites, blogs, graphics, wordpress, emails, web apps, and interfaces. If you're looking for an affordable local web developer or graphics designer to handle your small business website, ecommerce website, or just general maintenance. I'm your man!</p></br></br>

          <h2><img src="assets/images/book.svg">What I do</h2>
          <p>I am a designer, developer, and so much more. Basically, I design and build websites. I excel at HTML, CSS, Javascript, Adobe, Bootstrap, Shopify, and Wordpress. From well designed landing pages, emails, and SPA's to entire websites. Some other technical skills of mine include responsive design, SFTP/FTP, google dev tools, and I am proficient with essential linux command line tools notably git.</p> <br/>
          <p>Although I enjoy front-end development and UI design because of the freedom I have to paint my vision, I'm also effective at thoroughly assessing my clients desires and designing an experience that matches their personal expectations.</p>
